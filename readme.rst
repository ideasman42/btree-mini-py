BTree Mini
==========

A small, left leaning red-black btree.
for the purpose of having a good small binary-tree
which can be included in other projects or used as a reference.

The module provides ordered equivalents to both ``dict`` and ``set``:

- ``BTreeMap`` ordered (key, value) storage.
- ``BTreeSet`` ordered keys (no values).
